# Index

The organisation is as follows:
* analysis: R scripts for data wrangling, analysis and visualization.
  * simulation: .R script for power analysis for experiment 1.
  * tables
  * figures
* data/exp1: pre-processed data (i.e., anonymised data) in .csv. 
  * horse_race_exp1_rawdata: pre-processed, anonymsed data for analysis.
  * horse_race_exp1_surveydata and _reviewed: data from survey to check whether participants noticed the manipulation and feedback on the task.
* experimental-script: scripts used to run the experiment on jsPsych.
  * combinations-latin-square-design.csv: all combinations of horse description, speaker, and manner of delivery, resulting in 24 lists.
  * test_your_luck_exp1.jzip: file to upload to MindProbe to run the experiment, as coded on jsPsych.
  * jspsych-trials-exp1: directory with .html files (one per list) to run the experiment on jsPsych.
* manuscript: .rmd file for manuscript write-up.
* stimuli: stimuli for experiment, divided into auditory, descriptions and visual stimuli.
  * visual stimuli: files associated with the visual stimuli used in experiment 1.
    * /experimental-images: four .jpg files used in experiment 1.
    * /validation: eight .jpg files used for validation & one .csv with validation data (validation-images.csv) & .R script for data analysis (validation-images.R).
  * horse descriptions: files associated with the horse descriptions used in experiment 1.
    * experimental-descriptions.md: .md file with the different descriptions explored for experiment 1.
    * data-validation-attheraces.csv, data-validation-butterworth1.csv, and data-validation-butterworth2.csv: validation data for all the iterations of descriptions explored.
    * validation-attheraces.R, validation-butterworth1.R, validation-butterworth2.R: R scripts to analyse the validation data.
