  abstract = "Where native speakers supposedly are fluent by default, nonnative
              speakers often have to strive hard to achieve a nativelike
              fluency level. However, disfluencies (such as pauses, fillers,
              repairs, etc.) occur in both native and nonnative speech and it
              is as yet unclear how fluency raters weigh the fluency
              characteristics of native and nonnative speech. Two rating
              experiments compared the way raters assess the fluency of native
              and nonnative speech. The fluency characteristics were controlled
              by using phonetic manipulations in pause (Experiment 1) and speed
              characteristics (Experiment 2). The results show that the ratings
              of manipulated native and nonnative speech were affected in a
              similar fashion. This suggests that there is no difference in the
              way listeners weigh the fluency characteristics of native and
              nonnative speakers. \copyright{} 2014 Language Learning Research
