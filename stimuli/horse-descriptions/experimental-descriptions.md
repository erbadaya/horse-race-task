In Experiment 1, participants hear the description of four horses provided by two different speakers. Prior to the experiment, we validated our descriptions to ensure that no horse was more likely to receive a larger/smaller bet by virtue of their performance.

Initially, we gathered a series of horse descriptions from *At the Races* website, retrieved on November, 2022. We validated these stimuli on Qualtrics, by having a set of 30 participants rank the horses in the order they thought they would cross the finish line if they were to compete in the same race. Analysis showed significant differences in the rankings.

We then selected Butterworth's (2019) materials (retrieved from *The Racing Post* in October, 2018). We asked a new sample of 30 British English participants to rate on a 10-point scale how likely they thought each horse was to win a race and then to rank all the horses. Analysis of this data showed a slightly skew for two horses, whose description happened to contain the word 'winner'. We thus edited these descriptions and validated them in a sample of new 30 British English participants (same task as previously described). The results of this second iteration of Butterworth's materials showed no differences in each horse's likelihood to win a race. 


# Initial descriptions

| Horse   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Horse 1 | Successful in a hurdle race and a chase at 2 miles on good to soft and yielding ground. Beaten a short head by Benito when second of 12 at 7-2 favourite on his latest outing in a hurdle race at Cartmel over 2 miles 6 furlong (good to soft) in June. Won at Newcastle in February and reached the frame 3 times during the summer, only going down narrowly when a fast-finishing second at Cartmel last time. Highly respected after 155 days off.                                                            |
| Horse 2 | A winner of a hurdle race at 2 miles 4 furlong on good ground. Third of 9 behind Starlyte beaten 6l at 7-1 on his latest outing in a hurdle race at Newcastle over 2 miles 4 furlong (good) earlier this month. Runner-up at Sedgefield last month and ran another good race after a spin on the Flat when third at Newcastle (20.3 furlong, good) 18 days ago. Solid place claims again from same mark.                                                                                                           |
| Horse 3 | Successful in a hurdle race and a chase at 2 miles 3 furlong and 2 miles 7 furlong on good to soft and soft ground. Well beaten at 13-8 favourite behind Do You Think when fourth of 5 on her latest outing in a chase at Hereford over 3 miles 1 furlong (good to soft) earlier this month. Belatedly off the mark in this sphere when taking 6-runner handicap at Worcester (23 furlong, heavy) last month. Failed to fire at Hereford 12 days later but she will have every chance if able to bounce back here. |
| Horse 4 | Successful in a hurdle race and a point-to-point at 2 miles and 2 miles 7 furlong on good to soft ground. Won on his latest outing in a hurdle race when 11-8 favourite at Kelso over 2 miles 7 furlong (good to soft) earlier this month, beating Gaillimh A Stor by a neck. Successful pointer who finally came good over hurdles in 22.5 furlong Kelso novice 23 days ago. Unexposed as a stayer and should be very competitive back in a handicap.                                                             |

# Butterworth (2019) materials 

This are Butterworth's materials after editing them (i.e., our experimental stimuli).

| Horse       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Fire Walker | Fire Walker is looking strong thanks to his come-from-behind success in the Acomb Stakes. The impression given in both runs is that Fire Walker should handle the demands of the extra furlong and Charlie Hills is looking forward to the test. The trainer said "He's done really well for a little break, his work's been good and I couldn't be more pleased with him". |
| Silver Sky  | Silver Sky, a runner-up of a seven-furlong maiden at Naas on his debut last month, the son of Invincible Spirit ran crack French colt Persian King to a neck in the Group 3 Autumn Stakes over today's trip at Newmarket two weeks ago and his trainer believes he has done well since. O'Brien said "Silver Sky is a fine big colt and a talented one".                    |
| Apocalypse  | Apocalypse has put in a string of consistent performances, most recently finishing third to Norway in the Zetland. "He's had a very solid year" said trainer Archie Watson. "He ran a good race in the Zetland, beaten only a length and a quarter, and I think the field here is of a similar level so I'm more than happy for him to take his chance".                    |
| Black Blade | Black Blade proved the market all wrong as the complexion of the 6.5 furlong novice race changed dramatically in the final two furlongs, with the Rebel Racing premier-owned newcomer under Tom Queally collaring long-time leaded Monsieur Noir. Spencer said: "He did it well. He's a nice horse. We always thought had a bright future".                                 |
