	<h1><center>Welcome to our study!</center></h1>
	<p>This study is conducted by __ANONYMISED FOR PEER REVIEW__.</p>
		<p>	By taking part in this experiment, you confirm that you accept the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Your anonymity will be preserved and the data gathered will not have any link to your identity. Only the researchers will have access to this data.</li>
		<li>Non-identifiable data will be uploaded to OpenScience framework. If you wish to withdraw your data, please contact the researcher at the address below. You have 14 days since your participation to ask for your data to be withdrawn before it is uploaded to OpenScience framework. </li>
		<li>The results of this study may be written up for publication or conference presentation. No identifiable information will be shared.</li>
		<li>No risks or benefits are associated with this study.</li>
		<li>You can withdraw the experiment at any time without explanation. However, you will receive your compensation only if you complete the full experiment. You can ask for your data to be destroyed up to 14 days since your participation.   </li>
		<li>This research has been approved by the __ANONYMISED FOR PEER REVIEW__</li>
		</ul>
		<p>	If you have any further questions regarding the study, please contact __ANONYMISED FOR PEER REVIEW__. </p>

	<h2>What do you have to do? </h2>
	<p>In this experiment, you will complete two tasks.</p>
	<p>In the first task, you will listen to two reporters of horse races talking about an upcoming race at __ANONYMISED FOR PEER REVIEW__. These speakers will talk about the horses taking part in this race.</p>
	<p>You will be given £100 virtual pounds to bet in these horses. Your task is to bet in the four horses, as long as the total amount adds to £100. </p>
	<p>Afterwards, you will answer some questions about the experiment and your demographic background.</p>
